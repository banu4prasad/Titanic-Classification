# Titanic-Classification

## Descripition
A Titanic classifier is a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic would have survived or not. This classifier utilizes historical data from the Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers among any other features.

## Features
- **Embarked :** Port of Embarkation.
- **SibSp :** Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
- **Pclass :** Ticket class which is a proxy for socio-economic status.

## Technologies Used
- **Data Preprocessing :** The classifier employs data preprocessing techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables, ensuring the input data is suitable for training the model.
- **Feature Engineering :**  Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the modelâ€™s performance.
- **Prediction :** Using the trained model to predict whether a passenger survived or not on the test data.

# Programming Languages used
- Python3
